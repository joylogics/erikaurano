A student film by Erika Urano

This short was an experiment in using a single, continuous shot to create a sense of immersion and unease. Erika wanted to see how much emotional weight could be carried without cutting — relying instead on pacing, movement, and the quiet tension between what’s seen and what’s felt. It’s one of her first explorations into themes of vulnerability and identity.
