Short film by Erika Urano

This short film was an early attempt to explore the feeling of being seen without being safe. Inspired by Junji Ito’s The Town Without Streets, Erika used a minimal setup and quiet pacing to experiment with how space and stillness can create tension. It’s part of her ongoing interest in identity, surveillance, and the invisible pressures we live under.
