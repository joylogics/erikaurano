**Emotional Ball** explores the physicality of emotions through the simple metaphor of a bouncing sphere. The animation investigates how feelings have weight, momentum, and trajectory - how they bounce, roll, and settle in the landscape of our inner world.

This piece examines the unpredictable nature of emotional movement and the way feelings can surprise us with their sudden appearances and departures.
