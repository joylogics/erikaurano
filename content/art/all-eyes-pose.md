**All Eyes Pose** examines the weight of being observed and the complex relationship between the watcher and the watched. This piece captures a moment of acute awareness - the sensation of feeling all eyes upon you.

The work explores themes of vulnerability, performance, and the ways we compose ourselves when we know we're being seen.

*Materials: Digital drawing*
