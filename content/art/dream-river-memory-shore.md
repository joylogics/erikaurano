**Dream River Memory Shore** explores the liminal space where memories flow like water and dreams wash up like debris on the shores of consciousness. This piece investigates how our past experiences shape our present reality through the metaphor of a riverbank where time becomes fluid.

The work examines the way memories can be both crystalline and elusive, solid and liquid, permanent and ever-changing.
