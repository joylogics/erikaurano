**Flipbook** pays tribute to the fundamental magic of animation - the persistence of vision that brings static images to life. This piece captures the intimate, handmade quality of traditional flipbook animation.

Each frame was carefully crafted to explore the relationship between stillness and movement, celebrating the tactile joy of creating motion through sequential drawings.
