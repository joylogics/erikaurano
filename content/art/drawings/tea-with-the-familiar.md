**Tea with the Familiar** captures the quiet ritual of sharing space with that which is both comforting and mysterious. This piece explores the domestic sphere as a place where the ordinary and extraordinary coexist.

The work examines how familiarity can contain depths of strangeness, and how the most intimate moments can reveal the most profound mysteries.
