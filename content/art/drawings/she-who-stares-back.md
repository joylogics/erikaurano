**She Who Stares Back** confronts the power dynamics inherent in looking and being looked at. This piece explores the moment when the subject of observation becomes the observer, challenging the traditional roles of watcher and watched.

The work investigates themes of agency, representation, and the complexity of female subjectivity in relation to the male gaze.
