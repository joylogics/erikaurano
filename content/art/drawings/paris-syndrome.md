**Paris Syndrome** delves into the psychological phenomenon of profound disappointment when reality fails to match our idealized expectations. Named after the condition experienced by some visitors to Paris, this work explores the universal experience of disillusionment.

The piece examines how our preconceptions can create a chasm between what we hope to find and what actually exists, and the emotional aftermath of that disconnect.
