**Inner Cartography** explores the complex terrain of internal emotional landscapes. Through careful layering and delicate mark-making, this piece maps the invisible geography of thought and feeling.

The work invites viewers to consider their own inner navigation systems - the ways we orient ourselves within our own consciousness and chart paths through our personal histories.

*Materials: Mixed media on paper*
