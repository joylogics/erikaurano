Erika Urano is a senior Film & Television major at NYU Tisch School of the Arts, where she explores storytelling through screenwriting, directing, and production design. With a creative voice that's equal parts introspective and irreverent, Erika brings quiet intensity and a wry sense of humor to her work — often blending drama, comedy, and elements of horror.

Raised in New Jersey just outside New York City, Erika grew up speaking English and Portuguese at home, with strong ties to both her Japanese and Brazilian heritage. She speaks some Japanese and has spent the past two summers in Japan studying language and culture. Most recently, she spent a semester abroad at NYU’s London campus, further expanding her international perspective and artistic sensibility.

Erika’s portfolio includes short films where she’s taken on roles as writer, director, and production designer. She’s currently interning at a film production firm, reviewing submitted screenplays and gaining firsthand insight into how stories evolve from page to production. Beyond film, Erika is also an illustrator — her website includes a collection of her drawings — and she brings a strong visual eye and design sensibility to every project she works on.

She is currently seeking internships and part-time opportunities in film production, screenwriting, or other creative roles, including positions in art galleries or studios.
